# Human Twin for Microsoft Teams

![Technical Architecture](technical.png)

## Overview
This project introduces an innovative solution to enhance virtual meeting experiences through an autonomous digital twin. Born from the need to streamline daily standup meetings, this virtual human twin serves as an intelligent presence in Microsoft Teams video calls, capable of understanding context and intent while maintaining natural communication.

## Key Features

### Autonomous Client-Side Component
The core of this solution is a sophisticated client-side component that operates independently within Teams meetings. It processes audio input in real-time and performs multiple AI-driven inferences:

- **Speech-to-Text Processing**: Converts spoken words into text for context understanding
- **Emotion Analysis**: Analyzes speech patterns to detect emotional context
- **Real-time Visual Synthesis**: 
  - GPU-accelerated frame manipulation
  - Lip-sync generation synchronized with speech
  - Emotion-driven facial expressions
  - Intent-based visual responses

### Technical Innovation
The system orchestrates multiple AI inferences simultaneously on GPU hardware, achieving real-time performance with minimal latency. This enables seamless integration of speech processing, emotion analysis, and visual synthesis in a fraction of a second.

## Use Cases
- Automated attendance in daily standup meetings
- Virtual presence in routine team meetings
- Intelligent meeting participation with context awareness
